### fancybox

Deprecated. As the CosCMS is able to enable other repos as source we will just use orginal repo as clone source for now on. 

This means we just use: 

https://github.com/fancyapps/fancyBox

in build profiles that uses the jquery fancybox extension. 

In this manner you can now add any remo git repo to a build profile.
